# EDU_chatbot
The main objective of this application based chatbot was to develop an effective conversation which  will identify user questions or queries and answer accordingly. It could be involved in performing  various tasks like design textbooks, deliver course content, develop test questions, and evaluate the  answers, monitor online discussions, and tutor students. This ensures that when an ambiguous or  irrelevant input is detected, the bot asks the user to rephrase the question appropriately. Such implementations will make interactions with Chatbots of the future indistinguishable from human interactions. With development of these application based chatbot in schools, universities can engage  with the prospective students right from the point of admission to making learning fun for them. The  potential uses for chatbots are endless, and with advances in natural language processing and machine learning, chatbots will only continue to become more sophisticated and valuable for businesses as well  as other industries.
